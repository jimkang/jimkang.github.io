Or you want to only see the last letter of every paragraph in Ars Technica articles to see if there’s some secret message. Or perhaps something&nbsp;useful.</p>

One way to do this is open the developer tools in your browser and just start messing with stuff. But if you want to let everyone else mess with web pages in the way you were thinking, that won’t work. For quite a long time, people have been using Greasemonkey scripts to pass on the mischief to other Firefox&nbsp;users.</p>
