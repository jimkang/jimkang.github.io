<p>I talked to a friendly manager at a garage in the morning on Saturday. He explained a problem with my car via a demonstration, which was novel to me. It won me over and made me feel I could trust this garage. He said they could probably have the problem fixed by 6 <span class="caps">PM</span> that night, but if not certainly by Sunday. I agreed to the repair and&nbsp;left.</p>
<p>That turned out to be a&nbsp;mistake.</p>

They could see the reply if they scrolled down in their timelines,&nbsp;however.</p>
<p>For them, it was a frustrating experience. They’d get a notification, then go to Notifications and couldn’t find&nbsp;anything.</p>
