          <section class="content"><p>It’s a new month, so it’s time for me to once again be shocked that it’s a new&nbsp;month!</p>
<p><span class="more"></span>
I was going to say it was a month of mostly just incremental progress, but now that I think about&nbsp;it:</p>
<ul>
<li>We went on two&nbsp;trips.</li>
<li>We went to our most distant and tougest judo tournament yet (to be clear, my kid competed, not&nbsp;me)</li>
<li>We ran birthday party, and it seemed to be&nbsp;fun.</li>
<li>Middle school started and seems to be fine, if long and&nbsp;early-starting.</li>
<li>Various activity plans got figured&nbsp;out.</li>
<li>We got Bonus Cat on medication that seems to be making him feel better and somewhat more active. (He is a seventeen-year-old cat with a heart condition.) Just yesterday, he jumped up on the counter to drink chicken stock that I had left up there to cool. (<a href="https://smidgeo.com">Smidgeo</a> is well-versed in illegal stock&nbsp;manipulation.)</li>
</ul>
<p>Also, this was in July, but Dr. Wily, our other cat, who is also old but not as old as Bonus, got cancer — and beat cancer! For now. That was an uncomfortable time for us. There was a possibility that it had spread from her mammary gland to her lungs. The surgery and X-ray revealed that it did not,&nbsp;however!</p>
<p>Afterward, she had to take this terrifying drug that turned her into soulless <span class="caps">A.I.</span> Wily for a while, but the vet let us stop it. She still had to wear a <a href="https://smidgeo.com/daily-mrrp/daily-mrrp-drhXEhLM.html">donut</a> but took that surprisingly&nbsp;well.</p>
<p>I did not find new work in August. (I’m available for <a href="https://ghostcrab.io/">contract</a> or <a href="https://jimkang.com/resume/">hire</a>)  In personal small triumphs, though, I got past a string of days in which I was really tired and another string of nights in which I’d wake up with a really dry throat every&nbsp;morning.</p>
<p>I’ll take what I can&nbsp;get.</p>
<p>In art news, I scrapped an approach to a visualization that I started in July. I think it was the right move, which I wish I had considered earlier, but better late than&nbsp;never.</p>
