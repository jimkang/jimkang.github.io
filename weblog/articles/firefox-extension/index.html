          <section class="content"><p>A few weeks ago, I found myself having to do a thing over and over again in my browser. It was&nbsp;cumbersome.</p>
<p>And so, it was time for me to reduce this pain by making <a id="linkorigin-find" href="/weblog/articles/firefox-extension/#footnote-find"><sup>1</sup></a> a browser&nbsp;extension.</p>
<p>However, the last browser extension I wrote was in 2013 <a id="linkorigin-last-ext" href="/weblog/articles/firefox-extension/#footnote-last-ext"><sup>2</sup></a>. <span class="more"></span>(It was a <a href="https://lifehacker.com/back-again-tracks-every-time-you-visit-a-site-1588729519">web habits tracker</a>.) Here in 2025, I had no idea what browser extension development was&nbsp;like.</p>
<p><a href="https://jimkang.com/weblog/articles/writing-dom-modifying-extensions/">This is what extension development was like back then, at least for Chrome.</a> How different is it&nbsp;now?</p>
<p><em>Not that different, actually!</em> That’s amazingly stable for a software platform. Those of you that just wanted to know that can close the tab&nbsp;now.</p>
<hr>
<p>But if you need to re-learn how extension development works, like I did, here is how my 2025 Firefox extension <a id="linkorigin-addon" href="#footnote-addon"><sup>3</sup></a> was put&nbsp;together.</p>

<h2 id="i-the-problem-why-i-need-the-extension-">I. The problem (why I need the&nbsp;extension)</h2>
<p></a>
I use <a href="https://github.com/jimkang/note-sender">note-sender</a> to post to my weblogs. Here’s what note-sender looks&nbsp;like.</p>
<p><img src="note-sender.png" alt="A web page with archive, password, and note text fields and a browse for media button"></p>
<p>note-sender posts to note-taker <a id="linkorigin-note-taker" href="#footnote-note-taker"><sup>4</sup></a> which handles the actual updating of the weblogs. It is an <span class="caps">API</span> that is the ultimate destination for the content that the extension captures from the web&nbsp;page.</p>
<p>Five years ago or so, my picture-posting process usually went like&nbsp;this:</p>
<ul>
<li>I took a picture on my&nbsp;phone.</li>
<li>I immediately opened note-sender (also on my&nbsp;phone).</li>
<li>In note-sender, I:<br><br><ul>
<li>Uploaded a photo or&nbsp;video</li>
<li>Wrote a note about&nbsp;it</li>
<li>Posted&nbsp;it</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>For whatever reason, the process evolved&nbsp;into:</p>
<ul>
<li>Take picture on my&nbsp;phone.</li>
<li>Put away my phone and forget I took the&nbsp;photo.</li>
<li>Let hours or days&nbsp;pass.</li>
<li>Let my phone <a href="https://www.flickrhelp.com/hc/en-us/articles/4404064061076-About-the-Auto-Uploadr-Flickr-app">auto-upload</a> all of my photos to Flickr in the&nbsp;background.</li>
<li>Look at Flickr on my computer and notice the picture; realize that I’d like to post it to a&nbsp;blog.</li>
<li>Either:<ul>
<li>Get my phone&nbsp;out</li>
<li>Open&nbsp;note-sender</li>
<li>Hit the media browse&nbsp;button</li>
<li>Scroll through the many pictures taken since that particular photo was taken to find the photo (I often gave up at this&nbsp;step)</li>
<li>Write some text and&nbsp;post</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Or:<ul>
<li>Stay on the Flickr page on my&nbsp;computer</li>
<li>Click on the download&nbsp;button</li>
<li>Select a&nbsp;size</li>
<li>Confirm that it is <span class="caps">OK</span> to the download to the&nbsp;computer</li>
<li>Open&nbsp;note-sender</li>
<li>Hit the media browse&nbsp;button</li>
<li>Find the photo file in the file&nbsp;system</li>
<li>Write some text and&nbsp;post</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In a sense, the extension doesn’t actually save me that much work. It lets me&nbsp;skip:</p>
<ul>
<li>Downloading a&nbsp;photo</li>
<li>Leaving the page I’m on to go to another page&nbsp;(note-sender)</li>
<li>Searching the Photo Roll or file system for a photo
<br><br></li>
</ul>
<p>Does that really&nbsp;matter?</p>
<p>Actually, <em>yes</em>. That’s enough friction to make me skip posting. Especially if it’s the second or third time I’m posting during the photo browsing session. Sad but&nbsp;real!</p>
<h3 id="what-my-extension-needed-to-do-to-fix-this">What my extension needed to do to fix&nbsp;this</h3>
<p>From a Flickr photo page (<a href="https://flickr.com/photos/ignignokt/54441124850/">example</a>), the extension needed to enable me&nbsp;to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Click on a button (without leaving the Flickr&nbsp;page)</li>
<li>Write some text in a&nbsp;box</li>
<li>Select a saved&nbsp;login</li>
<li>Hit a button to post to a&nbsp;weblog</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="extension-anatomy">Extension&nbsp;anatomy</h2>
<p></a></p>
<p>Just like eleven years ago, the extension has a manifest. There is a version 3 format, but if, like me, you don’t want to bother with learning version 3, you can still use version 2, at least in Firefox. The manifest describes what scripts are in the extension, where they are, and what resources they&nbsp;need.</p>
<p>Here is mine,&nbsp;annotated.</p>
<pre><code>{
  &quot;manifest_version&quot;: 2,

  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;Flickr to note-taker&quot;,
  &quot;description&quot;: &quot;Posts images from the Flickr page you&#39;re on to note-taker&quot;,
  &quot;version&quot;: &quot;1.0.0&quot;,
</code></pre><p>The <code>permissions</code> state what the extension needs to touch and where they need to&nbsp;act.</p>
<pre><code>
  &quot;permissions&quot;: [
    &quot;tabs&quot;,
    &quot;https://*.flickr.com/*&quot;,
    &quot;https://*.staticflickr.com/*&quot;
  ],
</code></pre><p>The <code>page_action</code> object below says that when the browser is at a url starting with <code>https://flickr.com/photos/</code>, it should show an icon in the <span class="caps">URL</span> bar that has the tooltip “Send to notes”. When that button is clicked, a web page defined in <code>form.html</code> should show up in a&nbsp;popup.</p>
<pre><code>  &quot;page_action&quot;: {
    &quot;default_icon&quot;: {
      &quot;19&quot;: &quot;flickr-to-note-taker_icon_19.png&quot;,
      &quot;38&quot;: &quot;flickr-to-note-taker_icon_38.png&quot;
    },
    &quot;default_title&quot;: &quot;Send to notes&quot;,
    &quot;default_popup&quot;: &quot;form.html&quot;,
    &quot;show_matches&quot;: [&quot;https://flickr.com/photos/*&quot;]
  },
</code></pre><p>This <code>content_scripts</code> object tells the browser what script to run in the context of pages starting <code>https://flickr.com/photos/</code>.</p>
<pre><code>  &quot;content_scripts&quot;: [
    {
      &quot;matches&quot;: [&quot;https://flickr.com/photos/*&quot;],
      &quot;js&quot;: [&quot;get-photo-download.js&quot;]
    }
  ],
</code></pre><p>These are the icons the browser should display in various contexts, like the url bar&nbsp;button.</p>
<pre><code>  &quot;icons&quot;: {
    &quot;16&quot;: &quot;flickr-to-note-taker_icon_16.png&quot;,
    &quot;48&quot;: &quot;flickr-to-note-taker_icon_48.png&quot;,
    &quot;128&quot;: &quot;flickr-to-note-taker_icon_128.png&quot;
  },
</code></pre><p><img alt="URL bar with the extension icon on the right side of it" src="url-bar-icon.png">
<br><br>
The id in <code>browser_specific_settings</code> needs to be unique if you want to sign it, which we’ll talk about <a href="/weblog/articles/firefox-extension/#signing">later</a>.</p>
<pre><code>  &quot;browser_specific_settings&quot;: {
    &quot;gecko&quot;: {
      &quot;id&quot;: &quot;flickr-to-note-taker@smidgeo.com&quot;
    }
  }
}
</code></pre><p><a id="ui"></p>
<h2 id="ui"><span class="caps">UI</span></h2>
<p></a></p>
<p>Now that we have toured the parts of the extension, let’s look more closely at the <span class="caps">UI</span>&nbsp;part.</p>
<p>When the user clicks the popup button in the url bar, <code>form.html</code> is diplayed. Here is what that looks&nbsp;like.</p>
<p><img src="popup.png" alt="A Flickr photo page with a form showing in a popup extening from the browser url bar."></p>
<p>And this is the code for <code>form.html</code>.</p>
<pre><code>&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
  &lt;title&gt;Note Sender, Jr.&lt;/title&gt;
  &lt;link rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; type=&quot;text/css&quot; href=&quot;app.css&quot;&gt;&lt;/link&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Status&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;status&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;section class=&quot;global-props ccol&quot;&gt;
  &lt;h4&gt;Archive&lt;/h4&gt;
  &lt;input type=&quot;text&quot; id=&quot;archive&quot; value=&quot;&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;h4&gt;Password&lt;/h4&gt;
  &lt;input type=&quot;password&quot; id=&quot;password&quot; value=&quot;&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;h3&gt;Alt text&lt;/h3&gt;
  &lt;input class=&quot;alt-text&quot; type=&quot;text&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;textarea class=&quot;note-area&quot; data-of=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;&lt;/textarea&gt;
  &lt;button class=&quot;submit-note-button&quot;&gt;Note!&lt;/button&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

(FYI: For the purposes of managed passwords, the url of this form is &lt;span id=&quot;popup-url&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.)

&lt;script src=&quot;form.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</code></pre><p>The event handler for clicking on the Note! button in <a href="https://github.com/jimkang/flickr-to-note-taker-extension/blob/main/extension/form.js"><code>form.js</code></a> takes stuff from the inputs and posts it to an <span class="caps">API</span> endpoint. If you are familiar with web apps, you’ve seen this kind of thing over and over. But there are a couple of functions that are specific to extensions in that file that we should look&nbsp;at.</p>
<p><code>sendMessageToDownloader</code> runs as soon as the page loads. It looks for the active browser tab that has the Flickr photo page loaded, and sends it a message to the content script telling it to start downloading the&nbsp;media.</p>
<pre><code>async function sendMessageToDownloader() {
  try {
    var activeTabs = await browser.tabs.query({ active: true, url: &#39;https://flickr.com/photos/*&#39; });
    var tab = activeTabs?.[0];
    if (!tab) {
      throw new Error(&#39;Could not find the Flickr tab.&#39;);
    }
    await browser.tabs.sendMessage(tab.id, { command: &#39;start&#39; });
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(error);
    statusEl.textContent = error.message + &#39; tab &#39; + tab.id;
  }
}
</code></pre><p><code>form.js</code> has another event handler, <code>onMessage</code>, which we register with <code>browser.runtime.onMessage.addListener(onMessage)</code>. It will receive the reply from the content script in <code>onMessage</code> and will save binary form that message as well as some metadata for later use by the <code>onSubmitClick</code> handler.</p>
<pre><code>function onMessage({ mediaBuffer, type, filename }) {
  buffer = mediaBuffer;
  mediaType = type;
  mediaFilename = filename;

  statusEl.textContent = &#39;Media with length &#39; + buffer.byteLength + &#39; and type &#39; + mediaType + &#39; is ready to post.&#39;;

}
</code></pre><div class="aside">There is one more unusual bit that you may be interested in if you’re making an extension that requires the user to fill out a password:
<br><br>
<code>document.getElementById(&#39;popup-url&#39;).textContent = window.location.href;</code>
<br><br>
Extension popups have a weird url of the form <code>moz-extension://[uuid]</code> and aren’t exposed to the user. The reason the user might want to know that url is so they can associate passwords with that url in Firefox’s password manager. Once they’ve saved passwords for the extension url, they can easily fill in the password by right-clicking on the password field and selecting “Use saved password.” I personally use <a href="https://www.passwordstore.org/">pass</a> for “important” passwords, but I use Firefox’s password manager for blog passwords.</div>

<p><a id="page-work"></p>
<h2 id="page-work-simulating-the-user">Page work: Simulating the&nbsp;user</h2>
<p></a></p>
<p>The code that gets the photo or video binary and gets it to <code>form.js</code> is in content script, <a href="https://github.com/jimkang/flickr-to-note-taker-extension/blob/main/extension/get-photo-download.js">get-photo-download.js</a>.</p>
<p>It is mostly <span class="caps">DOM</span> querying and timeouts, the kind of code you tend to see in programs like end-to-end tests that mimic a person clicking on a sequence of things in a web&nbsp;page.</p>
<p><code>get-photo-download.js</code> clicks on this button (circled in red)&nbsp;—</p>
<p><img src="flickr-download-button.png" alt="Flickr photo page with download button"></p>
<p>— in order to make this menu&nbsp;appear:</p>
<p><img src="flickr-download-menu.png" alt="Flickr download menu listing various image sizes">
Once it finds the menu items, it grabs the <code>href</code> value of the Large size link and fetches the image from that <span class="caps">URL</span>. Then, it passes the ArrayBuffer containing the image to the listener in <code>form.js</code> via a <code>browser.runtime.sendMessage</code>.</p>
<div class="aside">In the case of a Flickr video page, there won’t be a download menu because there aren’t multiple sizes available. There will be a single download link, but the video file there is not playable on some platforms.<br><br>Instead of getting the media binary from a download link like we do in the photo case, we grab the video file from the <code>&lt;video&gt;</code> player element’s <code>src</code> attribute because the version Flickr puts there will be widely playable. I know it plays in Firefox on Ubuntu and on Mobile Safari, at least.</div>

<h2 id="workflow-completion-in-the-ui">Workflow completion in the&nbsp;<span class="caps">UI</span></h2>
<p>Back in <code>form.js</code>, the message is received, and the media ArrayBuffer is saved to the module closure. Whenever the user clicks the “Note!” button, that ArrayBuffer is packed into the form data for a <span class="caps">POST</span> to the note-taker endpoint. Other than status updates about how that POST went, the extension’s work is&nbsp;done.</p>
<p><a id="sequence-diagram"></p>
<h2 id="informal-sequence-diagram">Informal sequence&nbsp;diagram</h2>
<p></a></p>
<p>In short, the action in the extension flows like this (start following from&nbsp;“init”):</p>
<p><img src="flickr-to-note-taker.svg" alt="Function flow diagram"></p>
<p><a id="packaging"></p>
<h1 id="iii-packaging"><span class="caps">III</span>.&nbsp;Packaging</h1>
<p></a></p>
<p>Extension files are just zip files, even though they have an <code>.xpi</code> extension. There’s a couple of other considerations,&nbsp;though.</p>
<h2 id="development">Development</h2>
<p>While you are developing your extension, you can load it without having to zip it by going to <a href="about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox">about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox</a>, clicking “Load Temporary Add-on…”, and pointing the file dialog to the directory where you extension files&nbsp;are.</p>
<p><a id="signing"></p>
<h2 id="signing">Signing</h2>
<p></a></p>
<p>Because this extension is just for myself, I wanted to just load it unpacked and be done. But unpacked debug extensions do not persist after you close and reopen the browser, so I needed to zip and sign the&nbsp;extension.</p>
<p>When zipping, make sure the zip structure is flat — no&nbsp;subdirectories.</p>
<p>Signing an extension, while nowhere near nightmarish as signing an iOS app, is still a hassle. <a href="https://extensionworkshop.com/documentation/publish/signing-and-distribution-overview/">You can read about it&nbsp;here.</a></p>
<p>Here’s a couple of things that tripped me up about&nbsp;it:</p>
<ul>
<li>The docs are ambiguous about how long you have to wait after you submit the zip file for approval. (Approval for signing, not for public consumption.) Mine was approved in five minutes by an automated&nbsp;process.</li>
<li>The approval email will say that it is available at a url of the form <code>https://addons.mozilla.org/developers/addon/&lt;some numbers&gt;/versions</code>. This is probably a me thing, but I had trouble finding the actual extension file.<br><br>Click on an item in the version history. On the version page, there will be a small Files section with the link to the xpi file. (The xpi file is just the zip file with a different&nbsp;extension.)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="installation">Installation</h2>
<p>Once you have that file, install it by going to <a href="about:addons">about:addons</a>, clicking the gear icon, selecting “Install Add-on From File”, and selecting the zip&nbsp;file.</p>
<p><img src="addons-config.png" alt="Add-ons configuration page"></p>
<p>You can go a step further and make it available to other people by <a href="https://extensionworkshop.com/documentation/publish/submitting-an-add-on/">submitting it to the Add-Ons Developer Hub</a>, but that’s a whole thing that requires you to create a Firefox account and set up <span class="caps">2FA</span>,&nbsp;etc.</p>
<p><a id="all-together"></p>
<h1 id="all-together-now">All together&nbsp;now</h1>
<p></a>
Once the extension is installed, here’s how it&nbsp;works.</p>
<p><img src="extension-at-work-1.png" alt="Firefox add-ons config page with Flickr to note-taker selected">

<p>It’s saved me a lot of time and allowed me to make posts I otherwise would not have bothered with. If there’s some cumbersome web doings in your life,
consider making something like this yourself!<a href="#footnote-find"><b>*</b></a></p>
<div class="aside"><b id="footnote-find"><sup>1</sup></b> An even better way to make your life easier is to find an extension that already exists, but that wasn’t an option for me. If you can read code, it’s a good idea to <a href="https://jimkang.com/weblog/articles/making-sure-an-add-on-is-safe/">make sure that the extension you find is safe</a>, though. <a href="#linkorigin-find">⤴</a></div>
<div class="aside"><b id="footnote-last-ext"><sup>2</sup></b> After writing this entire post, I looked at Back Again? again and realized that I had actually <a href="https://github.com/jimkang/backagain/commits/master/">updated it in 2021</a> but completely forgot about that.<a href="#linkorigin-last-ext">⤴</a></div>

<div class="aside"><b><sup id="footnote-note-taker">4</sup></b> <a href="https://github.com/jimkang/note-taker">note-taker</a> is a <span class="caps">REST</span> service that uses <a href="https://github.com/jimkang/static-web-archive">static-web-archive</a>, a static site generator. It was <a href="https://jimkang.com/weblog/articles/platform-free-bots/">originally written</a> to be easy for bots to post to, but now I use it for my own non-automated microblogs, like <a href="https://smidgeo.com/daily-mrrp/">my cats blog</a>, a <a href="https://smidgeo.com/take-a-break/">relaxation videos collection</a>, a <a href="https://smidgeo.com/notes/argh-i-forgot/">record of things I couldn’t remember</a>, <a href="https://ghostcrab.io/devlogs/">various devlogs</a>, and some family microblogs.<br><br>Most static site generators require you to run a build on your laptop after you write something and then upload the built site to your web server. note-taker runs 24/7 on a server to receive posts so that I can post to it from my phone. I do not have to be at my laptop to rebuild and upload a site.<br><br><div class="aside">You could put a service like this up in front of any static site generator and get the same benefits.
