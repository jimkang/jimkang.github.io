<p>Did you want to know how a vocoder works? (You know, that thing Newcleus used to put the robot voice in their&nbsp;songs.)</p>
<p>Assuming you said yes, you’re in luck! I have a <a href="https://jimkang.com/channel-vocoder">step-by-step walkthrough</a> that explains how the original vocoder worked right&nbsp;here:</p>
<h2 id="https-jimkang-com-channel-vocoder"><a href="https://jimkang.com/channel-vocoder">https://jimkang.com/channel-vocoder</a></h2>
<p><span class="more"></span>
And after you’re done going through the walkthrough, there’s a New Game+ so to speak, in which you can just use the web app as a vocoding&nbsp;tool.</p>
<hr>

<p>This kind of vocoding produces some pretty rough stuff, though. I tried for a few hours, and I could not find a way to use it in a composition. (Contemporary sources report than Homer Dudley’s original vocoder was fairly harsh,&nbsp;too.)</p>
<p>Still, I was <em>thrilled</em> to get something going that could produce the recognizable (if not intelligible) combination of a pitched signal and an unpitched speech signal, and I look forward to attempting to make a slicker vocoder. (And then possibly a weirder&nbsp;vocoder.)</p>
<h2 id="more-modulation-">More&nbsp;modulation!</h2>
<p>This <a href="https://jimkang.com/channel-vocoder">channel vocoder explainer</a> is a followup to <a href="https://jimkang.com/weblog/articles/miscellaneous-findings-008/">this finding</a> on modulation in general. And all of these efforts are a part of my attempt to learn about signal processing during my time at the <a href="https://recurse.com/">Recurse Center</a>.</p>
<p>I’ve really enjoyed the Recurse Center so far. Ironically, I can’t write about that right now because it tires me&nbsp;out.</p>
<h2 id="songs-collected">Songs,&nbsp;collected</h2>
<p>One more small note before my writing juice runs out: I put together a <a href="https://jimkang.com/music/">site that collects my “weekly” songs</a>. <a href="https://jimkang.com/music/rss/index.rss">It also has an <span class="caps">RSS</span>&nbsp;feed.</a></p>
<p>Even though I fell off the weekly thing, when I was doing it, it was good for the spirit and for the composing muscles, regardless of the quality of the output, which varied wildly. I hope to get back to it once Recurse is&nbsp;over.</p>
<p>I hope your haps are good. You should email some haps to me, in&nbsp;fact!</p>
<p>Excelsior,<br>Jim</p>
