I started out using a module that used Google's deprecated image search API, and one day, it just stopped working. I ended up writing my own scraper. 2) A lot of Google image search results point to dead images. When you're on Google itself, that's no big deal. You just move on to the next result. On Slack, it's far more disappointing, since you get only one search result. (Multiple results would be overwhelming.) For that reason, I added result auditing, which made it a slower – but still better – experience.",
